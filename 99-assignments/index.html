    <h1>Assignments</h1>

    <p class="hero-text" data-js-markdownit>
      Every assignment has its own little home ‚Äî a self-contained folder where all the magic happens. Inside, you‚Äôll find everything you need: sketch-File, config files and sometimes a SharedWorker pulling the strings behind the scenes. Feel free to jump right in and experiment directly in the folder. Or, if you're the cautious type, make a quick copy before you start breaking things in the best possible way. This setup keeps your ideas tidy and your experiments easy to run, remix, or rescue.

    <h2>01. Share Data between Windows</h2>

    <div class="content">

      <div data-js-markdownit="">
        **Objective:**
        Use one or more of the core communication techniques (e.g. `window.opener`, `postMessage`, `localStorage`,
        `BroadcastChannel`, or `SharedWorker`) to share position data between two browser windows.

        **Task:**
        You are given a starter file with a code skeleton. Your job is to implement a working communication
        channel that allows each window to display:

        * Its **own position** (based on `window.screenX` / `screenY`)
        * The **position of the other window(s)**

        Use the concepts and techniques discussed in workshop to send and receive this data. Feel free to choose an
        approach that makes
        sense to you. Bonus: if you try more than one and compare the results.

        **Hints:**

        * Use `setInterval()` to track and send position changes regularly
        * Store or transmit positions as a simple object: `{ position.x: ..., position.y: ... }`

        **Optional Challenge:**
        Make the update reactive (e.g. use the `storage` event or `BroadcastChannel.onmessage`) instead of relying on
        polling.

        **Time limit:** 30 minutes

    <h2>02. Draw Line between Windows</h2>

    <div class="content">
      <div data-js-markdownit="">
        **Objective:**
        Using p5.js and a predefined SharedWorker, draw a line between two browser windows. The line should connect the
        **center of your current window** to the **center of the other connected window**. The visual goal is to give
        the impression of a single, shared canvas that spans across both windows.

        **Task:**
        You are given a code skeleton and a working `SharedWorker` that handles metric exchange between connected
        windows. Extend the p5 sketch so that a line is drawn from **your own center** to **the other window‚Äôs center**.

        **Optional Challenges:**
        - color of the line depends on the position of the window
        - thickness of the line depends on the distance between the windows
        - add easing so the line endpoint smoothly follows the movement of the other window‚Äôs center.

        **Time limit:** 20 minutes

    <h2>03. Dual-Window Visualization Experiment</h2>

    <div class="content">

      <div data-js-markdownit="">
        **Objective:**
        Explore the creative possibilities of multi-window visual composition. Build on the provided radial line sketch
        and extend it to create an expressive, dynamic visualization that spans two browser windows.

        **Task:**
        You are given a starter sketch with a radial arrangement of lines in one window. Your job is to turn this into
        an **interactive or generative visual system** that lives across two windows. You can expand, distort, animate,
        or synchronize elements between the windows‚Äîanything that reacts or communicates across the boundary.

        This is not about perfect alignment, but about experimenting with form, connection, and coordination.

        **Suggestions (not required):**

        * Use shared metrics (position, size, center) to distort the visual depending on where the other window is
        * Create symmetry, mirroring, or interaction between radial elements across both windows
        * Animate elements in one window based on what happens in the other (e.g. movement, time, alignment)
        * Use easing, color changes, or layout shifts to respond to distance or position

        **Time limit:** 30 min

    <h2>04. Casting ‚Äì Visual Handoff Between Windows</h2>

    <div class="content">

      <div data-js-markdownit="">
        **Objective:**
        Create a shared visual system where a graphic element (or entire visualization) ‚Äúmoves‚Äù from one window to
        another when the windows overlap. The goal is to simulate a kind of *casting* or *transfer* of responsibility
        between two browser windows.

        **Task:**
        You are given a starter sketch with a simple visual and a functioning SharedWorker. Extend it so that:
        * When two windows **visibly overlap** on the screen, the visual **moves to the other window**
        * The system feels like the visual is being *passed* from one window to the next

        You‚Äôll need to:
        * Continuously track each window‚Äôs screen position and size
        * Detect when bounding boxes of windows intersect
        * Decide which window is currently ‚Äúhosting‚Äù the visualization
        * Use the SharedWorker to broadcast and synchronize handoff state

        **Time limit:** 30 min
