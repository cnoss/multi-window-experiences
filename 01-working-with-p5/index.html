    <h1>Working with p5.js</h1>

    <div class="hero-text" data-js-markdownit>**[p5.js](https://p5js.org/)** is an open-source JavaScript library
      that brings the core principles of creative coding to the web. It was initiated in 2013 by [Lauren
      McCarthy](https://lauren-mccarthy.com/), an artist and programmer, as a browser-based reinterpretation of
      [Processing](https://processing.org/), the influential visual programming environment developed by [Casey
      Reas](https://reas.com/) and [Ben Fry](https://benfry.com/) at the MIT Media Lab.

      Built with accessibility and inclusivity in mind, p5.js is part of the mission of the [Processing
      Foundation](https://processingfoundation.org/), which supports the development of tools and learning resources
      that
      promote diversity in art, design, and technology. The library provides an intuitive API for working with drawing,
      animation, interaction, and media—all within the browser using HTML5 and JavaScript.

      Today, p5.js is widely used in art schools, classrooms, hackathons, and digital art installations. It continues to
      foster a global community where code becomes a tool for visual storytelling, experimentation, and cultural
      critique.

        <div data-js-markdownit>
          **p5.js** is a JavaScript library for creative coding that runs directly in the browser. It uses a simple
          sketch
          structure based on two main functions: [`setup()`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/setup), which runs once at
          the
          beginning, and [`draw()`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/draw), which runs continuously like a loop. You can
          use
          it to draw shapes, animate visuals, and respond to user input.

          To get started, you can write your code in the [p5.js Web Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/) or include the
          library
          in your HTML file.
        </div>

        <p data-js-markdownit>
          Here's a simple example of a p5.js sketch that draws an ellipse that follows the mouse cursor:

          More info and examples are available at the [official p5.js website](https://p5js.org/) or the [p5.js
          Reference](https://archive.p5js.org/reference/).

      <h2>Easing Functions</h2>

      <div class="content">
        <p data-js-markdownit>To create smooth animations, we can use easing functions. These functions control the
          acceleration and deceleration of an animation, making it feel more natural.</p>

        <h3>Example 1: Basic Easing</h3>
        <p data-js-markdownit>Here's a simple example of using an easing function in p5.js:</p>
        <div data-js-easing-code-example-1></div>

        <h3>Example 2: Spring-like Easing</h3>
        <p data-js-markdownit>Here's a more complex example. This sketch simulates a smooth, spring-like follower that
          appears to be pulled toward the mouse as if attached by a flexible rubber band. The motion includes a slight
          overshoot before settling back toward the target, resulting in a natural and organic animation similar to the
          visual behavior of an easeOutBack curve commonly used in motion design.</p>
