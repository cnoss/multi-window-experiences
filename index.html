    <h2>Core Concepts</h2>

    <div class="content">
      <p data-js-markdownit>This overview introduces several techniques for sharing data between browser windows,
        focusing on window positioning and state synchronization. It covers fundamental concepts such as detecting
        window position and observing changes, and explores communication strategies using `window.opener`,
        `postMessage`, `localStorage`, and `SharedWorker`. The final implementation builds on a SharedWorker with
        centralized state management, allowing multiple windows to share detailed metrics like position, size, and
        center point in real time. This architecture enables dynamic coordination across distributed browser views.</p>

    <h2>Working with p5.js</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p data-js-markdownit>This section provides an introduction to [p5.js](https://p5js.org), a JavaScript library for
        creative coding. It covers the basic structure of a [p5.js](https://p5js.org) sketch, including setup and draw
        functions, and demonstrates how to create simple shapes and animations. The goal is to familiarize you with the
        [p5.js](https://p5js.org) environment and its capabilities for visualizing data.</p>

    <h2>Single Window, Simple Object Example</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p data-js-markdownit>This example demonstrates how a simple objectâ€”represented as a circleâ€”is centered in a
        single browser window. When the window is moved, the circle appears to briefly stay in its original screen
        position before smoothly returning to the center of the window. This creates a subtle physical effect that
        visually emphasizes the motion of the window itself.</p>

    <h2>Single Window, Complex Object Example</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p data-js-markdownit>In this example, a more complex visual object responds to window movement using the same
        screen-relative mechanic as before. Instead of a single circle, a radial structure made of multiple lines is
        centered in the window. When the window is moved, the entire object appears to lag behind momentarilyâ€”remaining
        in its original screen positionâ€”before easing back into the center. The radial form enhances the impression of
        physical drag and realignment, making the effect more expressive and visually dynamic.</p>

    <h2>Multi-Window, Simple Object Example</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p data-js-markdownit>In this example a line spans across two browser windows. The line connects the
        center points of the two windows, creating a visual link between them. This demonstrates how to share data
        between multiple browser windows and use it to create a simple visual representation of the relationship
        between the windows.

    <h2>Multi-Window, Complex Object Example</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>This sketch creates a radial network of animated lines that visually connect the center of one window to the center of another. Each segment is defined by layered strokes, colors in motion, and dynamic skewing. As the windows move, the geometry shifts, weaving together screen space into a single shared structure. The result is a living pattern that spans across multiple viewsâ€”fragmented but visually continuous.</p>

    <h2>Rotating Circles Example</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>This sketch visualizes the relationship between two windows through rotating, noise-infused radial structures. Each windowâ€™s shape orients itself toward the other, creating a sense of attention and awareness across screen space. As the distance between windows changes, the form stretches and shifts, enhanced by subtle noise and color gradients. The result is a living, directional figure that constantly re-aligns as windows move, rotate, and drift apart.</p>

  <section id="centered-dot" class="collapsible">
    <h2>Centered Dot Example</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p data-js-markdownit>This example demonstrates how a simple dot can be centered in the middle of the screen. The dot remains in the center even when the window is resized or moved.</p>

      <p>
        This code adjusts the canvas based on the browser windowâ€™s position on the screen, allowing the sketch to stay aligned with the physical screen space. By translating using -window.screenX and -window.screenY, it relates the drawing to the windowâ€™s location on the screen â€” not just the browser viewport. This is useful when multiple windows or screens are involved and you want consistent positioning relative to the actual screen, not just within the browser.

    <h2>About</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>The Multi-Window Experiences with p5.js workshop explores the creation of synchronized, interactive visuals across multiple browser windows using p5.js. Participants delve into techniques for detecting window positions and facilitating real-time communication between windows through methods like window.opener, postMessage, localStorage, and SharedWorker. This hands-on session is part of the "Web-Technologien" seminar within the "Weaving the Web" focus of the Master's program in Media Informatics at TH KÃ¶ln.</p>

      <p data-js-markdownit>Prof. [Christian Noss](https//christiannoss.de) brings his expertise in creative coding, web development, and interface design to the workshop. As a professor at TH KÃ¶ln, he teaches modules such as "Generative Gestaltung" and "Web Technologies," emphasizing the fusion of design and technology. </p>

      <p data-js-markdownit>For more information about the workshop, please visit the [Web-Technologies](https://th-koeln.github.io/mi-master-wtw/web-technologien/) website.</p>
