    <h2>Core Concepts</h2>

    <div class="content">
      <p data-js-markdownit>This overview introduces several techniques for sharing data between browser windows,
        focusing on window positioning and state synchronization. It covers fundamental concepts such as detecting
        window position and observing changes, and explores communication strategies using `window.opener`,
        `postMessage`, `localStorage`, and `SharedWorker`. The final implementation builds on a SharedWorker with
        centralized state management, allowing multiple windows to share detailed metrics like position, size, and
        center point in real time. This architecture enables dynamic coordination across distributed browser views.</p>

    <h2>Working with p5.js</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p data-js-markdownit>This section provides an introduction to [p5.js](https://p5js.org), a JavaScript library for
        creative coding. It covers the basic structure of a [p5.js](https://p5js.org) sketch, including setup and draw
        functions, and demonstrates how to create simple shapes and animations. The goal is to familiarize you with the
        [p5.js](https://p5js.org) environment and its capabilities for visualizing data.</p>

    <h2>Single Window, Simple Object Example</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p data-js-markdownit>This example demonstrates how a simple object—represented as a circle—is centered in a
        single browser window. When the window is moved, the circle appears to briefly stay in its original screen
        position before smoothly returning to the center of the window. This creates a subtle physical effect that
        visually emphasizes the motion of the window itself.</p>

    <h2>Single Window, Complex Object Example</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p data-js-markdownit>In this example, a more complex visual object responds to window movement using the same
        screen-relative mechanic as before. Instead of a single circle, a radial structure made of multiple lines is
        centered in the window. When the window is moved, the entire object appears to lag behind momentarily—remaining
        in its original screen position—before easing back into the center. The radial form enhances the impression of
        physical drag and realignment, making the effect more expressive and visually dynamic.</p>

    <h2>Multi-Window, Simple Object Assignment</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p data-js-markdownit>This assignment explores how a visual element—such as a line—can span across multiple
        browser windows. The goal is to create the impression of a continuous object that exists beyond the boundaries
        of a single window. A simple example is a straight line that begins in one window and ends in another.
      </p>

      <p data-js-markdownit>TTo coordinate this across windows, shared state is required. This can be achieved using a
        [`SharedWorker`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SharedWorker), which enables multiple windows
        to access and update a common data structure. Alternatively, other core concepts such as `postMessage`,
        `localStorage`, or `window.opener` can be used, depending on the architectural approach.</p>
