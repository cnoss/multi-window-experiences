    <h2>Core Concepts</h2>

    <p data-js-markdownit>This overview introduces several techniques for sharing data between browser windows, focusing on window positioning and state synchronization. It covers fundamental concepts such as detecting window position and observing changes, and explores communication strategies using `window.opener`, `postMessage`, `localStorage`, and `SharedWorker`. The final implementation builds on a SharedWorker with centralized state management, allowing multiple windows to share detailed metrics like position, size, and center point in real time. This architecture enables dynamic coordination across distributed browser views.</p>

    <h2>Tools of the trade for visualisation</h2>

    <p data-js-markdownit>This section provides an introduction to [p5.js](https://p5js.org), a JavaScript library for creative coding. It covers the basic structure of a [p5.js](https://p5js.org) sketch, including setup and draw functions, and demonstrates how to create simple shapes and animations. The goal is to familiarize you with the [p5.js](https://p5js.org) environment and its capabilities for visualizing data.</p>
