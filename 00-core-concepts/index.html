    <h1>What are the different concepts and techniques for sharing window position data between browser windows?</h1>
    <p class="hero-text" data-js-markdownit>
      This chapter introduces key concepts and techniques for sharing data between multiple browser windows. It begins with the basics of detecting and observing window positions, then compares several communication approaches including `window.opener`, `postMessage`, `localStorage`, and `SharedWorker`. Each method is explored in terms of use cases, capabilities, and limitations. The chapter concludes with an advanced solution using a `SharedWorker` combined with centralized state management, allowing windows to share spatial data such as position, size, and center point in real time.

    <h2>Detecting Window Position</h2>

    <div class="content">
      <p>To detect the position of a window, you can use the <code>window.screenX</code> and <code>window.screenY</code>
        properties. These properties return the x and y coordinates of the window on the screen.</p>
      <p>For example, you can log the position of the current window to the console:</p>
      <pre><code>console.log('Window position:', window.screenX, window.screenY);</code></pre>
      <p>This will output the x and y coordinates of the window in pixels.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="observe-window-position" class="collapsible">
    <h2>Observe Window Position Changes</h2>

    <div class="content">
      <p>In modern browsers, you can't directly track changes to the browser window's position on the screen due to
        security and privacy restrictions. However, there is a partial workaround using the window.screenX and
        window.screenY properties. These give you the x and y coordinates of the window relative to the user's screen.
      </p>

      <p>You can monitor changes by polling these values at regular intervals. For example, you could use setInterval to
        check every 500 milliseconds whether the values have changed, and then react accordingly. That said, this only
        works reliably in popup windows or controlled browser environments. In normal browser tabs, these properties may
        return zero or be blocked entirely depending on the browser and the platform. Some browsers also limit access to
        this information altogether for security reasons.</p>

      <p>If you're building something that needs to detect repositioning, consider whether you can achieve your goal
        another way — for instance, by monitoring viewport size, scroll behavior, or window focus/blur events. Let me
        know
        what you're trying to build, and I can help you find a more robust approach.</p>


      <p>The window and screen objects in JavaScript offer several useful properties that can help you understand and
        respond to the browser window's behavior or environment—especially if you're working on something related to
        window positioning or resizing.</p>

      <h3>Useful window Properties</h3>
      <code>window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight</code>
      <p>
        Returns the viewport size (the visible area inside the window, excluding toolbars and scrollbars).
        → Useful for responsive design or checking if the window is minimized or resized.
      </p>

      <code>window.outerWidth / window.outerHeight</code>
      <p>
        Gives the full size of the browser window, including borders and toolbars.
        → Helps detect the total window dimensions, including chrome.
      </p>

      <code>window.screenX / window.screenY</code>
      <p>
        Returns the position of the window relative to the screen.
        → Handy for limited window movement tracking.
      </p>

      <code>window.devicePixelRatio</code>
      <p>
        Indicates the pixel density (e.g., Retina displays have a ratio > 1).
        → Useful when working with graphics or high-DPI support.
      </p>

      <code>window.screenLeft / window.screenTop</code>
      <p>
        Similar to screenX / screenY, more relevant for compatibility with older browsers.
        → Be cautious — support is inconsistent.
      </p>

      <h3>Useful screen Properties</h3>
      <code>screen.width / screen.height</code>
      <p>
        Returns the total screen resolution (e.g., 1920×1080).
        → Helps understand screen context or scale window sizes accordingly.
      </p>

      <code>screen.availWidth / screen.availHeight</code>
      <p>
        Gives the available screen size, excluding system UI like taskbars.
        → Useful for centering popups or maximizing windows within usable space.

  <section id="opener" class="collapsible">
    <h2>Using Opener</h2>

    <div class="content">
      <p>The <code>opener</code> property allows a window to reference the window that opened it. This is useful for
        sharing data between windows. For example, if you have a main window that opens a new window, you can use the
        <code>opener</code> property to
        access the main window's properties and methods.

  <section id="post-message" class="collapsible">
    <h2>Using Broadcast Channel API & PostMessage</h2>

    <div class="content">
      <p data-js-markdownit>The `postMessage` method allows you to send messages between windows. This is useful for
        sharing data
        between windows that are not related (i.e., they do not share the same opener).</p>

  <section id="local-storage" class="collapsible">
    <h2>Using Local Storage</h2>

    <div class="content">
      <p data-js-markdownit>The `localStorage` object allows you to store data in the browser. This is useful for
        sharing
        data
        between windows that are not related (i.e., they do not share the same opener). The data is **synchronous** and
        **string-based** (you store and retrieve strings only) and it doesn’t expire.</p>

    <div class="content">
      <p data-js-markdownit>The `SharedWorker` object allows you to create a worker that can be shared between multiple
        windows. This is useful for sharing data between windows that are not related (i.e., they do not share the same

      <h3>When to Use What?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Use <code>window.opener</code> for <strong>quick control between parent/child</strong>, but not for scalable
          systems.</li>
        <li>Use <code>postMessage</code> when <strong>direct but flexible messaging</strong> is needed.</li>
        <li>Use <code>localStorage</code> for <strong>persistent, simple key–value sync</strong>, with minimal effort.
        </li>
        <li>Use <code>SharedWorker</code> when you need <strong>live coordination across windows</strong>.</li>
        <li>Use <code>SharedWorker + central state</code> for <strong>real-time, stateful multi-window
            applications</strong> that require coordination, tracking, or shared logic.</li>
      </ul>

  <section id="final-solution" class="collapsible">
    <h2>Final Solution</h2>

    <div class="content">
      <p>This extended version of the SharedWorker-based Central State Management system now includes additional
        window-specific properties. In addition to tracking each window’s position, the system also observes its current
        size and automatically calculates its center point (midpoint). These values are stored centrally within the
        worker and kept up to date through regular updates. This provides a more complete spatial model of all active
        windows and allows for more precise coordination and layout logic across multiple browser views.</p>
